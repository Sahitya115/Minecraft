      <h2>1.1: Introduction</h2><br>
     <p>Minecraft and Roblox are the two of the most popular games with many differences between two of them. These two are popular because of their gameplay, features, multiplayer etc they provide to players.</p>
      <p>Here is the table below showing some of the differences between Minecraft and Roblox:-</p><br>
     <table>
         <caption>Table 1: Minecraft vs. Roblox</caption>
         <tr><th>SL. NO. </th><th>Category</th><th>Minecraft</th><th>Roblox</th></tr>
         <tr><td>1.</td><td>Gameplay</td><td>Minecraft offers an open-world sandbox experience where players gather resources, craft items, build structures, explore various biomes, and fight mobs. It focuses on survival, creativity, and exploration with physics-based interactions like mining and crafting.</td><td>Roblox isn’t a single game but a collection of millions of user-created games. Gameplay varies widely — from shooters to simulators, tycoons, roleplay, racing, horror, and more. Experience fully depends on the chosen game.</td></tr>
         <tr><td>2.</td><td>Story</td><td>Minecraft doesn’t have a fixed storyline. Players create their own goals. There are optional adventure elements such as defeating the Ender Dragon and exploring ancient cities. Lore is hidden and discovered by players through gameplay and updates.</td><td>Roblox has no universal story. Each game is independently designed by developers. Some have strong stories (like roleplay games), while others have none. Story depth depends on the creator.</td></tr>
         <tr><td>3.</td><td>Creativity</td><td>Minecraft emphasizes creativity through block building and redstone engineering that allows electrical-like systems, automation, and machines. Players design landscapes, houses, cities, or entire working computers inside the game.</td><td>Roblox provides deeper creative freedom because users can develop entire games. Using Roblox Studio and Lua scripting, players can build custom physics, GUI, gameplay systems, animations, vehicles, and entire worlds.</td></tr>
         <tr><td>4.</td><td>Modding</td><td>Strong modding support mainly in Java Edition. Thousands of community mods add new dimensions, mobs, technology, magic, biomes, performance, shaders, and new mechanics. Requires separate installation and can be complex for beginners.</td><td>Modding is built into the system through Roblox Studio. Instead of modifying existing games, users create new ones. Lua scripting allows total control of gameplay, making Roblox like a full development platform.</td></tr>
         <tr><td>5.</td><td>Singleplayer</td><td>Designed to support singleplayer strongly. Players can enjoy survival, creative building, adventure maps, or hardcore mode alone without needing servers or internet (except Realms or download extras).</td><td>Roblox heavily depends on multiplayer. Many games are designed for interaction, trading, or competition. Some singleplayer games exist but are less common.</td></tr>
         <tr><td>6.</td><td>Multiplayer</td><td>Supports LAN, online servers, cross-play across platforms, Realms private servers, mini-games, and survival SMP. Multiplayer can be controlled, private, or public.	Multiplayer is the core.</td><td>Roblox is a social platform where players join game servers created by others. Public servers dominate, and interaction with large global communities is common.</td></tr>
         <tr><td>7.</td><td>Pricing</td><td>Minecraft requires one-time purchase to play (Java/Bedrock). Optional costs include Realms subscription, marketplace skins, texture packs, and Minecoins, but game is fully playable without purchases.</td><td>Roblox is free to install and play. Most games include optional purchases using Robux. Many items and features require microtransactions and monetization varies widely between games.</td></tr>
         <tr><td>8.</td><td>Security</td><td>Generally secure, especially official Realms and offline play. Third-party servers may contain risks but generally manageable. Less exposure to scams because most content is official or controlled.</td><td>More vulnerable to scams, phishing, and unsafe community content due to open creation. Moderation exists but not always fast or perfect. Younger players require strict parental settings.</td></tr>
         <tr><td>9.</td><td>In game currency</td><td>Uses Minecoins, used only for marketplace cosmetic items, worlds, and texture packs. Cannot be earned in-game, cannot be converted to real money, no trading between players.</td><td>Uses Robux, which powers its entire economy. Can buy game passes, avatar items, boosts, etc. Developers can earn Robux and convert it to real money (DevEx program).</td></tr>
         <tr><td>10.</td><td>Goals & achievements</td><td>Has structured achievements like defeating the Ender Dragon, obtaining rare items, building automated farms, exploring dimensions, and survival challenges. Goals are open-ended and player-defined.</td><td>Goals depend on each game. Some games include leveling systems, badges, leaderboards, or story progression. Others may have no goals at all. Achievements vary with developer design.</td></tr>
         <tr><td>11.</td><td>key features</td><td>Open world sandbox, survival and creative modes, crafting system, redstone engineering, multiplayer servers, mods (add-ons in Bedrock edition) (which are develop in Java (Java edition) + C++ (Bedrock edition)), infinite world generation, realistic physics-based blocks.</td><td>Game creation engine, scriptable gameplay using Lua, customizable avatars, social interactions, marketplace economy, millions of games, game monetization, built-in development environment.</td></tr>
